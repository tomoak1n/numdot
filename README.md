# Pattern generator for the numdot problem by @hyuki (CodeIQ q468)

## Enumerate all partition of n different objects

The pattern is generated by recursive definition.

* When n=1 the simple partition is the only pattern [1]

* For cases n > 1
    * First prepare every pattern with n-1 objects.
    * For each of such pattern, add "n" to each partition or make an additional partition
comprised of "n" only.

The code (n3.rb) looks as follows:
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

def pgen(n)
  if n== 1
    return  [[[1]]]
  end
  retary = []
  pp = pgen(n-1)
  pp.each do |ary|
    ary.each_index do |i|
      np = ary.dup
      np[i] = ary[i].dup
      np[i] << n
      retary << np
    end
    np = ary.dup
    np << [n]
    retary << np
  end
  retary
end

pgen(5).map{|a| puts a.map{|b| b.join}.join(".")}
```
