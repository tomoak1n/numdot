# Pattern generator for the numdot problem by @hyuki (CodeIQ q468)

## Enumerate all partition of n different objects

The pattern is generated by recursive definition.

* When n=1 the simple partition is the only pattern [1]

* For cases n > 1
First prepare every pattern with n-1 objects.
For each of such pattern, add "n" to each partition or make an additional partition
comprised of "n" only.
